        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a traditional Palestinian-Lebanese way of making Zaatar. It can be then eaten by dipping bread in olive oil and in the Zaatar or as part of another recipe. Will hold for a long time in the pantry. This recipe scales for larger amounts so long you preserve the ratios.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Zaatar leaves (without the stalks), cleaned and dried.</li>
            <li>1 Cup sesame (optionally roasted).</li>
            <li>1 Cup Sumac.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Optional: citric acid salt, for extra kick if the Sumac was not enough for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly roast the sesame in a wide pan until it get a golden brown color.</li>
            <li>Wait for the sesame to completely cool down.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, starting from the Zaatar and sesame while adjusting the Sumac (optionally citric acid) and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Store in an airtight jar or container.</li>
        </ol>
